{"posts":[{"title":"Model Context Protocol (MCP)","text":"A Protocol for Simplifying LLM Application Development. Why MCP?Before MCP, most LLM apps rebuilt the same glue: Resource collection — where to pull context from (files, databases, calendars, screens, etc.) Tool wiring — how to call external services (search, code exec, web fetch, RAG, …) Prompt shape — how to consistently describe resources and tools to the model That’s brittle and expensive. MCP standardizes the surface so apps can: discover what data and tools exist, 2) describe them to the model, and 3) route tool calls—without app-specific adapters. Core concepts Resources — things you can read to build context (files, DB tables, dashboards, device state…).Each resource has an ID, human description, optional schema/metadata, and a way to fetch it. Tools — actions the model can call (search, translate, execute, query DB, open URL…).A tool has a name, description, arguments schema, and effect flags (e.g., “reads external data”, “mutates state”). Prompts — reusable prompt snippets MCP servers can publish (e.g., “SQL safety checklist”) for high-quality, repeatable guidance. Mental model123LLM app ─► MCP client ─► (one or more) MCP servers ├─ Resources (discover/fetch) └─ Tools (list/execute) Your app speaks only MCP. Servers implement whatever backends they want. Resource examplesMCP doesn’t force one URI scheme; servers should expose stable, URI-like IDs: 123file:///home/reda/notes/mcp_todos.mdpostgres://prod/orders?table=orders_2025screen://localhost/display1 Minimal resource descriptor (illustrative): 1234567{ &quot;id&quot;: &quot;file:///home/reda/notes/mcp_todos.md&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;MCP TODOs&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Personal notes about tasks and follow-ups.&quot;, &quot;mime&quot;: &quot;text/markdown&quot;, &quot;size&quot;: 4821} Fetching returns a payload (text or bytes) plus metadata: 123456{ &quot;id&quot;: &quot;file:///home/reda/notes/mcp_todos.md&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# TODO\\n- write MCP post\\n- push to blog\\n&quot;, &quot;etag&quot;: &quot;b2f9c3&quot;, &quot;updated_at&quot;: &quot;2025-09-14T10:21:00Z&quot;} Tool examplesA tool is described once; the model can then call it through the MCP client. 123456789101112{ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;web_search&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Search the web and return top snippets.&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: { &quot;query&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Search query&quot; }, &quot;top_k&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;default&quot;: 5, &quot;minimum&quot;: 1, &quot;maximum&quot;: 20 } }, &quot;effects&quot;: { &quot;reads_external_data&quot;: true, &quot;mutates_state&quot;: false }} Another: safe SQL query tool — 12345678910{ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;query_orders&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Run a parameterized query on the Orders view.&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: { &quot;from&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot; }, &quot;to&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date&quot; }, &quot;status&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;enum&quot;: [&quot;open&quot;, &quot;shipped&quot;, &quot;canceled&quot;] } }, &quot;effects&quot;: { &quot;reads_external_data&quot;: true }} Typical client flow Discover — list resources/tools from each MCP server. Select — for a user query, choose relevant resources (by rules or retrieval) and a small tool set. Describe — build a compact context card for the model: names + short descriptions of selected resources/tools any safety constraints / rate limits Call the model — provide the user message + context card. Route tool calls — execute via the MCP client; capture results (including errors) and stream them back to the model. Answer — return final text; optionally attach citations (resource IDs) and traces. Prompt snippetsServers can publish helpful prompts the client can insert: 12345{ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;sql_safety_prompt&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Safety checklist for SQL generation&quot;, &quot;arguments&quot;: []} Example usage in a system message: When using query_orders, never select *. Only named columns and limit to 200 rows.Use prepared parameters {from}, {to}, {status}.

Prefer brief descriptors + on-demand fetching. Constrain tools. Expose only what’s needed per turn; validate arguments against the schema. Trace everything. Log resource IDs, tool calls, and inputs/outputs for reproducibility. Fail loudly. Propagate errors to the model with clear messages; retry selectively. Cache. De-duplicate resource fetches by etag or hash. ConclusionsMCP reduces bespoke glue in LLM apps. You standardize how you discover data/tools, describe them to the model, and route tool calls. The result is simpler apps, safer execution paths, and easier portability across backends.

This post is a defensive, educational overview. Try things only on your own devices or in a closed lab you control. TL;DR You can learn a lot by capturing your own device’s traffic with Wireshark. Sniffing other people’s traffic on modern switched Wi‑Fi/LANs is not trivial and typically requires a man‑in‑the‑middle (MITM) position (e.g., ARP spoofing) — that’s an attack. I won’t publish step‑by‑step exploit commands here. The most useful takeaway: understand what metadata is visible, why encryption (HTTPS/TLS) matters, and how to defend against MITM. The setup (safe, legal)Create a tiny lab: One laptop/desktop (your machine) Optional: a second device you also own (phone/tablet) Both connected to your home router or a separate test AP Install tools: Wireshark – packet capture &amp; analysis 1sudo apt install wireshark Nmap – inventory devices you own on your test subnet 1sudo apt install nmap Eettercap 1sudo apt install ettercap-text-only Why sniffing is hard on real networksOld hubs echoed every frame to every port — trivially sniffable. Today’s switches forward frames only to the destination MAC, so your NIC generally sees only your own traffic, and broadcast/multicast (e.g., ARP, mDNS, DHCP). To see someone else’s traffic, an attacker would need to sit in the middle (MITM). A common technique is ARP spoofing/poisoning: trick hosts into sending frames to the attacker by lying about the MAC address for a given IP. This is explicitly malicious and out of scope here. Capture your own traffic with Wireshark Open Wireshark → select your active interface (e.g., wlo1 for Wi‑Fi). Start capture and browse a few websites, open an app, etc. Stop capture and explore. Useful display filters http – legacy HTTP (rare nowadays) tls – TLS handshake and encrypted application data dns – classic DNS queries (if not using DoH/DoT) tcp.port == 443 – most HTTPS traffic ip.addr == &lt;your_phone_ip&gt; – focus on a specific device in your lab Tip: Right‑click a packet → Follow → TCP/UDP stream. If the app uses TLS, you’ll see encrypted bytes. You can still learn who talks to whom (SNI/Server IP, cert info) without seeing the content. (High‑level) How attackers try to see others’ trafficI won’t include exploitation commands, but conceptually: Discovery: find devices on the subnet. Positioning: become the gateway for a victim and/or the router (e.g., ARP spoofing) to proxy traffic. Inspection/Modification: sniff or alter frames while forwarding. This is illegal without explicit permission. Instead, focus on the defenses below. Quick, safe commands referenceThese are fine to run on your own lab only: 12345# List interfaces and IPsip a# Inventory your *own* test subnetnmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 # replace with your lab range About MITM/Ettercap (why details are redacted)Placing yourself in the middle of other devices’ traffic requires ARP spoofing or similar techniques. Sharing the exact commands would enable harm, so I’m keeping this section high‑level and defensive. If you’re doing an authorized lab or pentest, consult official docs and get written permission first. Below is an example CLI output from a controlled lab run for educational discussion: Inspect traffic with WiresharkStart Wireshark and select your interface: 1sudo wireshark Select the wlo1 interface to start capturing: You’ll see traffic like this: Apply a display filter to focus on a specific device (example): Follow a UDP stream (conversation): You’ll notice the payload is unreadable — it’s encrypted (good!).Red = client; Blue = server. Note: Not all traffic is encrypted. Legacy http:// sites and some IoT protocols may still be in clear text — treat that as sensitive and remediate.
